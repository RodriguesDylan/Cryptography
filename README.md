# Cryptography
Different crypto projects and algorithm. Used sources can be found as headers in the files.

## SHA-256
Handmade SHA-256 implementation following NIST.FIPS.180-4 recommendation and using wikipedia' SHA-256 pseudocode. Comparaison with existing SHA-256 libraries.

## TO-DO
* Add time compare in SHA-256 [x]
* Do AES-128 / others
* Do broken crypto/hash algorithm folders (SHA-1 / MD5)
